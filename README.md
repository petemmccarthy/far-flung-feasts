# Far Flung Feasts

I made this app as a re-intorduction to the EmberJS framework which I have used previously. You can select or search/filter through a limited list of countries and you're displayed in recipe from that country.

## To be finished/bugs to fix...

* A form/input area for users to send in recipes
* More countries/recipes
* Map displying selected country/region
* Images
* Links to local takeaways/travel websites/cookbooks
* Further tests
* Needs a litle bit more styling!
